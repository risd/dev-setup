## Snippet installation instructions

This folder should be copied to the sublime **snippets** folder.

To find this elusive folder, make a new snippet through `Tools>New Snippet  `
Try saving this empty snippet and it should take you to the default Snippets folder.  
Copy this `neat-sublime` folder into the Snippets folder.

The shortcuts are:
```
n-span          @include span-columns( of );  
n-shift         @include shift();  
n-outer         @include outer-container();  
n-omega         @include omega;  
n-media         @include media($mobile) {
                    
                };
                @include media($tablet) {
                    
                };
                @include media($laptop) {
                    
                };
                @include media($desktop) {
                    
                };
```
